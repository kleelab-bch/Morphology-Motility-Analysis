# Breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles modulate the cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal metabolism of blood-brain barrier endothelial cells

## Abstract
This work utilizes machine learning analysis methods to examine cell morphology and motility features, in order to help comprehend similar or heterogeneous attributes among different cell types across various datasets. 


## Installation
To install necessary library packages, run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage(Testing) and Note
* Clone the repo to your project folder by using the following commend:

    ``git clone https://github.com/kleelab-bch/Machine-Learning-Analysis``


* Can directly run ``Main.py`` and the figures will be generated in ``Result_plot`` folder for testing. 
* Users can modify the file path to point to their own cell feature data.
* Be sure that this work mainly works on analyzing the morphology features (10 attributes) or motility features (9 attributes) of cells.
